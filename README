NAME

LWP::LastURI - routine for getting last URI visited despite redirects

SYNOPSIS

    use LWP::LastURI;

    my $agent = new WWW::Mechanize;
    
    # not that LWP user agents such as WWW::Mechanize may do redirection that 
    # will not be reflected in the return value of $agent->uri. 
    # This module offers a way to see the final URI after redirection.
    
    ... do stuff that involves redirection
    
    my $redirected_final = LWP::LastURI::last_uri;
    my $redirected_final_post = LWP::LastURI::last_uri('POST');
    my $redirected_final_get  = LWP::LastURI::last_uri('GET');

DESCRIPTION

If you want to see just what LWP is doing during a redirect, this program makes 
available a trace of sites visited. After a redirect, the site finally visited 
last can be retrived via a call to LWP::Debug::LastURI::last_uri. The optional 
argument can specify whether the latest 'GET' or 'POST' request is wanted. 
Otherwise, either a GET or POST uri is returned, whichever was latest.
